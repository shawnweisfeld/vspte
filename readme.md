 - **Custom wizards support**: adds your wizards to the package and calls them during project creation.
 - **Different .NET and VS support**: automatically replaces .NET and VS versions in the target project according to user's selection.
 - **Small fixes for template generation**: project items as links with relative paths support, .ps1/.cmd file replacements etc.
